Markets were rattled by a “SaaSpocalypse” narrative, with fears that AI “coworkers” could replace per-seat SaaS and wipe out software value. 2. Anthropic positioned Claude Opus 4.6 and “Claude Co-work” as end-to-end workers that can access files, run code, fix errors, and redeploy with plugins. 3. The discussion framed the shift as “service as software”, where outcomes are delivered directly by agents — potentially displacing junior workflow tasks like contract review. 4. Claude was also highlighted for “agent teams” that coordinate like a department (frontend, API, testing) to complete complex projects autonomously. 5. OpenAI’s GPT-5.3 Codex was described as a faster, coding-focused model with strong cybersecurity capability and additional safety controls. 6. Tech leaders (e.g., Jensen Huang and Sundar Pichai) were cited pushing back on “software is dead,” arguing winners will adapt by embedding AI. 7. Super Bowl ads turned into an AI rivalry stage, including Anthropic’s “no ads on Claude” message and broader AI-themed commercials. 8. Apple was said to be opening CarPlay to third-party AI integrations like Claude/ChatGPT (tap-to-use), while keeping Siri insulated ahead of future upgrades. 9. Cisco warned about “sleeper agents” hidden in downloadable AI-agent skills that behave normally until triggered to steal secrets like API keys. 10. Geopolitics and hardware escalated with “sovereign AI” efforts (including an Estonia education pilot), Singapore’s autonomous-drone push with Shield AI, and Cerebras’ reported $225M raise at a $23B valuation.
